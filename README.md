# Rock - Paper - Scissors
This watchOS application that I built is a famous Rock - Paper - Scissors Game. Rules of this game is simple. The aims is to beat a rock or a paper or a scissors. So, if you are presented with a paper you have to beat that. The scissors beats the paper because it cuts it. The paper beats the rock because it covers it. The rock beats the scissors because it crushes it. There are 20 levels in this game. In the end, the player gets a ‘YOU WIN’ or ‘YOU LOSE’ label.

In this project, I learnt to work with images, groups, timers and separator. I also learnt to work with proportional layouts and how to hide and show UI objects.
